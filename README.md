### 👋 👋 👋   Well, hey there! 😉 


My name is **Chi Bui**, and I am a **Data Scientist** with a focus in ✨ **Deep Learning** ✨

- 📍  I was born and raised in Vietnam, and am currently living in Tampa, Florida. 

- 🎓  I have just graduated from Flatiron School Data Science program (09/2021). I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology 🧠 
- 📈  Most recently, I worked on a [Bitcoin Volatility Forecasting Project](https://github.com/chibui191/bitcoin_volatility_forecasting).  
- 🌱  Since I'm on a roll 🍥 , my plan is to take [TensorFlow: Data & Deployment Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-data-and-deployment) next.


- 🤝  I’m **looking for a new position** where I get to utilize my skills in **Data Science** & **Machine Learning** (and learn some more). I am very **open to relocation**!  ✈️ |  🚘  | 🛵  | 🛶 | 🛳️  | 🪂 | 🚀
